<p>The Crawl Sudden Death Challenges is a competition that aims to fill a
Crawl niche not currently filled by the biannual version release tournaments.
The idea is for players to compete by trying to do as well as possible in a
game of Crawl with one attempt only; if you die, that challenge is over (thus
"sudden death", though you may&mdash;<em>will</em>&mdash;also die suddenly). This competition is
a lower time commitment event that aims to challenge players while
simultaneously encouraging unusual characters and play styles that you might
not normally consider.</p>

<p>Milestones from CSDC games will be announced in the IRC channel
<code>##csdc</code> on <a href="http://freenode.net">freenode</a>. 
It's a great place to hang out if you want to live spectate ongoing games or
talk with other people about the competition.</p>

<h2>Competition Format</h2>

<ul>
<li>Each challenge consists of playing a randomly chosen Crawl combo.</li>
<li>You get <em>one</em>  attempt to play each combo.</li>
<li>The goal is to advance as far as possible (and win!) in each game, scoring
points by reaching various in-game milestones.</li>
<li>Only games played and milestones scored between 00:00 UTC on the start and end dates count.</li>
<li>Details on rules and scoring are available on the <a
href="rules.html">rules page</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cool Plays</h2>

<p>If you do something particularly cool in your game make a note <code>cool
play</code> with the <code>:</code> command. Follow it with a second note
indicating where the play started and what makes it cool. The CSDC Replay team
will look through cool plays and post highlight reels from each week.</p>
